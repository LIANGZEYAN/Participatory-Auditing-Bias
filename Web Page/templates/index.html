    <h1>Document Relevance Study</h1>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <p>In this study, you will be asked to judge the relevance of documents with respect to a search engine query. You will be presented with a query and a set of 9 documents for which you will be asked to select <b>all documents</b> that are relevant to the query. For each document that you select as being relevant, you will be asked to highlight the passage of the text in the document that makes it relevant to the query. In total, you will be presented with xx queries each with 9 candidate documents.</p>
